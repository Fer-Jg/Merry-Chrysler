**Programmed in Windows 10 environment**

Important disclaimer: There might be a "python stopped working" thing at some point, it is normal since
I could not figure out how to run two processes (you'll understand in a minute) at the same time.

The "stopped working" warning will go away by itself 
after you give your input in console as asked by the program.


How to use:

1.- Run the program and follow console instructions
2.- The program will open your web browser, go enjoy some christmas there c:
3.- Once you are done checking out the browser, go back to the pyhton process' console
4.- In the console you will be prompted to type anything to continue, just do so.
5.- The grand finale will be available once you type anything, a new window will open
6.- Enjoy the new (and last) window! :D
