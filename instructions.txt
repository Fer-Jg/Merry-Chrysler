**Programmed in Windows 10 environment**

__Disclaimers__

**About "python stopped working"**

There might be a "python stopped working" thing at some point, it is normal since
I could not figure out how to run two processes (you'll understand in a minute) at the same time.
The "stopped working" warning will go away by itself 
after you give your input in console as asked by the program.

**About FPS**
You can change the web's animation FPS using `fps` global variable in the code, sadly I did not have
time to figure a better way to implement this since it was actually one of the first things I did
but ended changing up a lot due to newer implementations


**About downloads**

There will be files downloaded for experience's sake, it will be 1 mp3 
(which will be modified and splitted into a total of 3 sound files) and 1 png 
(which will be duplicated into a ico file)


**About possible Exceptions/Errors**
ICON: There might be an error with the icon saying that the ico could not be loaded, if that is the case just change the global
flag `use_ico` to False and it should be fixed on the next run.

MUSIC: The same as the icon, the music will be downloaded, converted and cropped to give a better experience, if for some reason
the music gives an exception or provokes an issue with the experience, it can also be turned off with the global flag
`use_music`
